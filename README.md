# Sentiment-Analysis

This project introduces a WhatsApp Chat Analyzer designed to extract valuable insights from the diverse conversations found within WhatsApp groups and personal chats.

The analysis aims to contribute meaningful data for applications like machine learning, where the quality of learning is intricately linked to the data provided to the model. 
Leveraging popular Python libraries such as seaborn, pandas, NumPy, streamlit, and matplotlib, the application seamlessly generates data frames and various graphs to illustrate patterns and trends within the chat data.
The simplicity and accessibility of these libraries make it user-friendly. 
This project thus facilitates an effortless exploration of WhatsApp data, providing a foundation for further analysis and insights in the realm of technology and machine learning.
